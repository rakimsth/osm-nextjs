## NEXT.JS INTEGRATION WITH OSM

We have used leaflet and react-leaflet package to integrate OSM with nextjs app.

## Idea

OpenStreetMap is an open-source, editable world map. It is free to use in any project and requires no API keys or authentication.

This post outlines how to embed a map image with a map pin of coordinates in a Next.js application, using Node.js packages such as React Leaflet. The image will contain a marker pinning to the set of coordinates defined.

To access OpenStreetMap in our Next.js application, we will use Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. To use Leaflet in our Next.js application, weâ€™ll use the React Leaflet, which comes with React components for Leaflet.
